This repository contains all source codes to reproduce results from my traffic-analysis research paper. 
I used official [Detectron realization](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/tree/f917a555bc422ed5e06a402e739da0e21b00d0b5) from Facebook as a start point. 

Refer to the Detectron for installation instructions. Short summary of the most relevant directiories:
- **maskrcnn-benchmark/traffic/scripts/models** - config files for used models
- **maskrcnn-benchmark/traffic/scripts/tuning** - TODO


Here is an example of how implemented system works at [day]() and at [night](). 
If you are interest in dataset, please email me(canxes@mail.ru).
